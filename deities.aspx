            Rama or Ram ( राम, Rāma ) is the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, and a 
king of Ayodhya in Hindu scriptures. Rama is also the hero of the Hindu epic 
Ramayana, which narrates his supremacy. Rama is one of the many popular figures 
and deities in Hinduism, specifically Vaishnavism and Vaishnava religious 
scriptures in South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered 
to be the most important avatars of Vishnu. In a few Rama-centric sects, he is 
considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar. Born as the eldest son of 
Kausalya and Dasharatha, king of Ayodhya, Ram is referred to within Hinduism as 
Maryada Purushottama,literally the Perfect Man or Lord of Self-Control or Lord 
of Virtue. His wife Sita is considered by Hindus to be an avatar of Lakshmi and 
the embodiment of perfect womanhood. Rama&#39;s life and journey is one of adherence 
to dharma despite harsh tests of life and time. He is pictured as the ideal man 
and the perfect human. For the sake of his father&#39;s honour, Ram abandons his 
claim to Ayodhaya&#39;s throne to serve an exile of fourteen years in the forest. 
His wife Sita and brother Lakshmana decide to join him, and all three spend the 
fourteen years in exile together. While in exile, Sita is kidnapped by Ravana, 
the Rakshasa monarch of Lanka. After a long and arduous search, Rama fights a 
colossal war against Ravana&#39;s armies. In a war of powerful and magical beings, 
greatly destructive weaponry and battles, Rama slays Ravana in battle and 
liberates his wife. Having completed his exile, Rama returns to be crowned king 
in Ayodhya and eventually becomes emperor, rules with happiness, peace, 
prosperity and justice—a period known as Ram Rajya. The legend of Rama is deeply 
influential and popular in the societies of the Indian subcontinent and across 
South East Asia. Rama is revered for his unending compassion, courage and 
devotion to religious values and duty.</asp:Panel>

        Hanuman was born to the humanoid creatures called the vanaras. His mother Anjana 
was an apsara who was born on earth as a female vanara due to a curse. She was 
redeemed from this curse on her giving birth to a son. The Valmiki Ramayana 
states that his father Kesari was the son of Brihaspati and that Kesari also 
fought on Rama&#39;s side in the war against Ravana. Anjana and Kesari performed 
intense prayers to Shiva to get a child. Pleased with their devotion, Shiva 
granted them the boon they sought.Hanuman, in another interpretation, is the 
incarnation or reflection of Shiva himself. Hanuman is often called the son of 
the deity Vayu; several different traditions account for the Vayu&#39;s role in 
Hanuman&#39;s birth. One story mentioned in Eknath&#39;s Bhavartha Ramayana (16th 
century CE) states that when Anjana was worshiping Shiva, the King Dasharatha of 
Ayodhya was also performing the ritual of Putrakama yagna in order to have 
children. As a result, he received some sacred pudding (payasam) to be shared by 
his three wives, leading to the births of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and 
Shatrughna. By divine ordinance, a kite snatched a fragment of that pudding and 
dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in worship. 
Vayu, the Hindu deity of the wind, delivered the falling pudding to the 
outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it. Hanuman was born to her as a 
result.Another tradition says that Anjana and her husband Kesari prayed Shiva 
for a child. By Shiva&#39;s direction, Vayu transferred his male energy to Anjana&#39;s 
womb. Accordingly, Hanuman is identified as the son of the Vayu.</asp:Panel>

        Ganesha also spelled Ganesa, also known as Ganapati and Vinayaka is a widely 
worshipped deity in the Hindu pantheon. His image is found throughout India and 
Nepal. Hindu sects worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha 
is widely diffused and extends to Jains, Buddhists, and beyond India. Although 
he is known by many attributes, Ganesha&#39;s elephant head makes him easy to 
identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of 
arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom.[8] As the god of 
beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rituals and ceremonies. Ganesha is 
also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several 
texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and 
explain his distinct iconography. Ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th 
and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta Period, although he inherited traits from 
Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. He was formally included among the five primary 
deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century. A sect of 
devotees called the Ganapatya arose, who identified Ganesha as the supreme 
deity. The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana, the 
Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.</asp:Panel>
