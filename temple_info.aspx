Keeping the Lord’s horoscope in the house and worshipping ensures great benefits to the devotee. The very presence of Lord’s horoscope in the house itself is a talisman that would remove all evils in the family and make it a happy abode. The Gupta section in Sarayu River from where Sri Rama left the earth to His Vaikunda after completing his avatar mission is 6 km from the temple. Presently, only the head of Sri Anjaneya on the Sarayu River bank is visible while it was colossal in size in olden days.

</strong></span><span class="style6"><strong>Ramayana philosophy: If and when a woman weeps, many reasons could be attributed.  If and when a man sheds tears, the cause is a woman.  This is what Ramayana tells us.  The very reading of Ramayana and writing the phrase ‘Sri Rama Jayam’ repeatedly ensure peace in homes and in society as a whole if done with an understanding of the story in letter and spirit.

        <strong>The lesson of Rama Charita: Man should ever be true to the wife in conjugal life.  He cannot be infidel to her because that itself would lead to his end. Treating the wife lovingly is prayer to Sri Rama.  Women should follow Mother Sita and develop patience

        </strong></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong><span class="style7">Greatness of Temple:</span></strong>
        <span class="style6">In the royal history of India where marrying more than one woman was a free license to kings, establishing their supremacy, Rama, till today, is a solitary example
committed heart and soul to Sita alone, a revolution he introduced in his own Ikshvahu dynasty.  We also see a high degree of celibacy in Hanuman.  Real heroism (Peranmai) according to Tirukkural lies in not looking at other women with a mischievous eye.  Rama lived that truth.  This quality brought special glory to Rama. 
On the other hand, Ravana’s eyes fell on the wives of others.  Mandodhari’s hurt heart, caused his destruction.  His unrighteous look at Sita claimed his life, which is evident from the lamentations of Mandodhari portrayed by Kavichakravarthi Kamban.

        <br />
        <span class="style7"><strong>Temple History:    
</strong></span><span class="style6"><strong>The Ram temple is built on the banks of Sarayu.  It is also said that Ayodhya was built by Manu, the first citizen of mankind.  It is also said that the Devas built the city for Krishna – Rama Avatara.  Mandadha, Dhilipan, Sakaras and Bhagiratha are some of the kings who adored the throne of Ayodhya followed by Dasaratha, grandson of Bhagiratha.   He married three wives, Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra and had four sons through them.
Had Dasaratha had only wife, even then he could have had four sons thus avoiding catastrophic developments later.  The multiple marriages made him bow before Kaikeyi and also paying a huge price – his death.
In a particular section of the temple, all have access to worship Rama.  Here, Sri Rama graces in a sitting form facing north.  A new temple, Ammaji Mandir is now built on the banks of Sarayu.  There are shrines for Sri Ranganatha and Sri Rama here.  Mother Sita, three brothers, Anjaneya and Garuda are with Sri Rama in the shrine.  This is a shrine where the devotee can worship all together
